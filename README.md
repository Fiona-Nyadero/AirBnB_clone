# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description

The AirBnB Clone Project is an endeavor to develop a web application inspired by AirBnB. This project serves as the initial step in building the application's infrastructure. It includes the creation of a parent class (BaseModel), serialization and deserialization of objects, and the implementation of various classes for AirBnB objects like User, State, City, and Place. Additionally, the project introduces the File storage engine for data storage and retrieval, along with a comprehensive set of unit tests for validation.

## Command Interpreter

### What's a Command Interpreter?

The Command Interpreter is a tool that enables users to interact with and manage objects within the AirBnB Clone Project. It is similar to a shell, tailored for the specific use cases of this project. With the Command Interpreter, you can:

- Create new objects (e.g., User, Place).
- Retrieve objects from various sources, such as files or databases.
- Perform operations on objects, including counting and computing statistics.
- Update attributes of existing objects.
- Destroy or remove objects from the system.

### How to Start It

To start the Command Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AirBnBClone.git
